# Java: ConcentrationGame
# This is a project from CSC331 course, Object-Oriented Programming.
# This is a memory game where you match a set of cards by color. 
# The user has the ability to change and set the number of card pairs that will be used for each game. 
# To set the number of card pairs you want, change the number in the main method, located in the GameBoard class, shown by the arrow down below.
# public static void main(String [] args) {
# new GameBoard(8); <--
# }
# It doesn't matter what number you put, whether it is very large or very small, as long as it's a positive number.
